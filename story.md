# Hi Jacob!

I'm Mike, and here's my entry to the #AllINeedChallenge.

## I started with a simple groove

## We can do better than that

Below, change the text `hh*3` to `psr:3*4`. Now change `xx` to `yy`. And instead of `hh*4`, how about `x*10`.

## But can we take it to entirely new places?

Let's find out! Click on the buttons below.

...and everything's still editable: press any of the colored buttons to sub out a sound for another, or choose from the list of samples on the left and right.

## But what about effects?

Let's get some EQ going, and a couple other tracks, and an LFO to boot! Try changing any of the parameters.

## Now let's kick it into hyperdrive

Let's write three functions called `silly`, `boing` and `moxy` that'll supercharge our challenge. You can change the functions & listen to what happens!

## But where are my sliders and knobs?!?

Let's add a UI. You can edit the text or use the UI during the jam - listen to what happens!

## I made this with my friends

**wags** is a text-based social DAW. Twenty of us did the #AllINeedChallenge together on the document below, all editing and playing at the same time. Send the link https://yap.wags.fm/p/all-i-need to anyone or share this QR code, and up to 100 people can edit the document together.

## Why I'm building wags

I'm building wags so that artists can embed dynamic musical experiences on their websites or in custom apps, just like the one you hear now. Fans can engage with your music in ways they never have before.

## Why else I'm building wags

I'm building wags because the tools we use shape the way we make music. Traditional DAWs are great, but the power of functional programming takes us to uncharted territory. The example below is only 15 lines long, but listen where it takes us...

## ...and the last reason

is because I love making music with folks all over the world. **wags** is a social platform. Artists can host & curate a session with up to 100 other people to co-create. Traditional DAWs are really hard to manage at this scale, and wags's text-based approach puts this in reach.

## What are we doing with wags

In 2022, our community will...
- Playing a rave in Stockholm with DJs around the world collaborating on a set.
- Have weekly jam sessions.
- Making over 10,000 unique works on the platform.

## Let's talk!

I'd love to give a full demo of the platform and imagine what new musical worlds we can explore together.
